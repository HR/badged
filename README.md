A service that provides you with a customizable download count badges for your
GitHub Releases. Allows you to keep track of your release downloads and let
others know how popular your releases are. Use virtually any badge service (e.g.
shields.io) you like! Uses GitHub API, Mongodb ðŸŒ±, Koa âš¡ and ES17 âœ¨.
Available for free.

## Features
- Get a shiny downloads badge to add to your projects' README.md
- Pretty-printed download count
- Get downloads badge for a specific release by
  - Id
  - Tag
- Get all-time (total) download count of all your releases
- Use any badge service of your choice (with any customization offered)
- Highly scalable service (see Scalability)

## Scalability
All downloads are updated at an interval of an hour so as to stay within the
GitHub API request limit and increase scalability. Updates are request-driven
meaning that download counts are only updated after the interval if the badge is
requested. Furthermore, advanced caching is used to ensure only modified data is
updated via conditional requests which also reduces API quota usage and
increases scalability.

## Usage
Using the Badged API is pretty simple, just form the badged link for the desired
repo badge and use it as the source of an image element.

HTML
```html
<img src="https://badged.co/HR/Crypter" alt="Downloads badge">
```
Markdown
```markdown
![Downloads badge](https://badged.co/HR/Crypter)
```

### Base url
The base url for all downloads badges is
```
https://badged.co/:username/:repo
```
Where `username` and `repo` are the GitHub username and repository respectively.

### Get downloads badge for latest release
```
https://badged.co/:username/:repo
```
By default, the base url yields a badge for latest release

### Get downloads badge for a release by id
```
https://badged.co/:username/:repo/:id
```
Where `id` is the GitHub Release id.

### Get downloads badge for a release by tag name
```
https://badged.co/:username/:repo/tags/:tag
```
Where `tag` is the GitHub Release tag name.

### Get downloads badge for all releases
```
https://badged.co/:username/:repo/total
```
The latest total download count for all releases is calculated when requested.

### Specifying a custom badge
By default, the shields.io downloads badge (i.e.
`https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-${DOWNLOAD_COUNT}-green.svg`) with the
calculated download count is sent as the response.

However, you can specify a custom badge URI _for any badge_ via the `badge`
parameter. The badge URI must include the `%s` substitution character, which
badged substitutes with the calculated download count (Pretty-printed), to yield
the correct downloads badge. E.g. if the download count is 1293 and the badge
URI is `https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-%s-red.svg` yields the badge
`https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-1,293-red.svg`

### Examples
- Downloads badge for the latest release `https://badged.co/HR/Crypter`
- Custom downloads badge for the latest release
- `https://badged.co/HR/Crypter?badge=https://img.shields.io/badge/downloads-%s-red.svg`
- Downloads badge for release by id `https://badged.co/HR/Crypter/5163582`
- Downloads badge for release by tag `https://badged.co/HR/Crypter/tags/v3.0.0`
- Downloads badge for all releases `https://badged.co/HR/Crypter/total`
